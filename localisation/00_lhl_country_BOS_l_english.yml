 BOS_golden_age:0 "Platinum Age of Islam"
 BOS_golden_age_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Arabian Chaliphate was a beacon of renaissance - a birthplace of geography, mathematics, medicine, physics and navigation. In XXI century, Bosnia became the beacon of science and culture once again - huge amounts of international aid and fervor of bosnian people led to incredible scientific advancement and newest industry to the former undeveloped and miserable eastern european country. Though the advancement had it's costs, the future of Bosnia is as bright as ever - because it dictates the future of the world itself."
 BOS_lybian_workshop:0 "Lybian Workshop"
 BOS_lybian_workshop_desc:0 "The price of advancement for bosnian people is considered too high for some of them: pollution, staff shortages, budget crisis, and, the worst of it - foreign influence and foreign demands. Traditionalist islamists and Gaddafi supporters are taking more and more prominent positions each day, and threaten the newly-build technocratic government, while the poor and lost uneducated people cannot find their place in the futuristic world this government builds. If not taken seriously, these factors may destroy the country and bring it from the bright Platinum Age straight into depths of the Dark Ages."
