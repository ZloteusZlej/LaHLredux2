 lhl_news.34.d:0 "Massive protests have erupted in Western Europe after the government's supposed green policies were little more than coverups of corruption. Despite promises there have been no solutions made to the fossil and nuclear energy plants. It is also confirmed that Linkola's eco-fascists in Finland were nothing more than a German-funded coup. Even more troubling news that one of Germany's energy resources of gas has all but dried up after the Eurasian collapse, which will likely lead to an energy crisis for the nation. The Chancellor has not yet commented on the humiliating news, but various members of the Reichstag have only shown outrage as they scramble for damage control.\nIt is alleged that the whistleblowers are known other then NSIS, who's motives are coming into fruition."
