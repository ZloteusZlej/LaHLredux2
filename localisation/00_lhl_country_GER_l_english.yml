 ##IDEAS##
 GER_green_prussia:0 "Green Prussia"
 GER_green_prussia_desc:0 "After the devastating disappearance of western globalism, the persistent balance of power in Europe became incredibly fragile. Separatist movements, ideological terrorism and civil unrest raised in power dramatically moments after the United States declared it’s forces leaving European continent. The Old World needed a new gendarme, and German authorities agreed to carry this heavy burden. Each day German society is becoming more and more militaristic and paternal to the surrounding countries, the only party having real power in the country – the Greens, are undoubtably highly influenced by military in their every decision. Some Germans are happy that their country is finally leading the world stage, some are disgusted by it’s new role as a world’s policeman, hated by everyone. But there is no doubt that the Green Prussia is not planning to loose it’s iron grip over Europe any time soon."
 GER_nsis:0 "NSIS"
 GER_nsis_desc:0 "No System Is Safe. This anonymous organization, started as an English cyberterrorist movement, aiming at German “peacekeeping” forces leaving their country, NSIS quickly became the Robin Hoods for German people, tired of corruption and unbreakable authority of the state. An anonymous hacker group, NSIS recruits new members every day, with each it’s new act becoming more and more threatening to the Greens and the military authorities. There are rumours, that NSIS is supported by France, Greece, Austrians and even Eurasian railway companies, but no valid proofs were found yet. Still, every anti-german power will surely win from NSIS success - because if their threats of leaking all scandalous information about German government will be executed, the “Europe’s Policeman” will be thrown in chaos, from which it may not be able to rise again.
