 POLITICS_BARKASHOW_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WAleksandr Petrovich Barkashov was born in an unremarkable working-class family near Moscow in 1953. He spent significant part of his youth in the army (which left an indelible imprint on his personality), later worked as a locksmith (without much success), taught karate and learned blacksmithing.\n\nIn 1990, together with the former supporters of «Pamyat'» society, Barkashov created the right-wing radical organization Russian National Unity, which would later take a side with the Communists in the 1993 coup.\n\nThe RNU reached its greatest success between 1993 and 1996. The Unity ranks included thousands of retired military men, so his militants, who had filled the streets at that time, started posing a real threat to the Jel'tsin regime. However, with the advent of the National Bolsheviks, the Barkashov movement lost credibility and fell into the margins of political life.\n\nThe crisis years of Medvedev’s reign give a new birth to RNU with numerous young nationalists joining the organization. During the chaos of the civil war first days, Barkashev’s militants took control of the number of cities in Northern Russia, but Aleksandr himself no longer had former influence on his stormtroopers, and so he was forced to share power with a number of young and ambitious leaders.§!"
