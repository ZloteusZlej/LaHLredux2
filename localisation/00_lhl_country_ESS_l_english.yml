 ESS_take_what_is_ours_desc:0 "For a while now, bandits operating out of London have been a disorganized mess - they lack cohesion, coordination, and combat effectiveness. They often steal from civilians, rather than targeting things that we need. Overall, they're clearly a missed opportunity, and the issues they cause in their current state outweigh the benefits of their loot. As such, Max Mosley has acted to restrain and reorganize the bandit gangs in London, issuing a decree to enforce discipline, military-style hierarchy, and transform them into an assault force optimized for sabotage and raids targeting war materiel and infrastructure."

Despite constant attacks from the local nationalistic bands, Tower's guards succesfully hold their little castle and survived on supplies from their local sympathizers. But despite all of that, their hope for the Royalists counterattack is almost gone by now.\n To finally prevent their actions in the heart of London, leaders of the local band of Dark Waters, considered for us two options on this question - To save the honor of the Tower's guards, and let them peacefully leave London up to their masters, for an obvious favor; Or just to fake a George's order to lay their arms and surrender to the local government."
