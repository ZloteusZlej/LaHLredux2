 KNT_event.1.d:0 "For all of its wealth, beauty, and traditional heritage, the good people of Kent now live surrounded by enemies on all sides. Having narrowly escaped King George's tyranny, some elements among our armed forces and even in the general population have yet to understand the necessity of our actions, protesting for a cause that ultimately seeks to enslave them. With a small industrial base and pool of manpower compared to our foes over in Wessex and Sussex, we no longer have the luxury of standing idly as the horrors of war seem poised to engulf our fair land.\nNow, in a renewed effort to ready the people for the coming battle, the Conservative government has further slashed social benefits and regulations on workplace safety, redirecting increasingly large amounts of the budget towards recruiting, training, and arming their military forces."

It’s expensive and unwieldy but the gun itself is rugged and versatile.\nA computer scientist and engineer brought a 3d printed gun, hastily painted black. Its modular construction and cheap parts make it an affordable choice, but is questionably reliable.\nFinally, a farmer and his son brought in a modified potato cannon, capable of launching grenades, potatoes, and a variety of explosive charges.\nAll three frontrunning designs seem to be capable of greatly boosting our urban warfare capacity"

The Neo-Victorians strive to unleash Britain's creative potential through a new, futuristic symbiosis of Britain's former glory and modern technological prowess, while the High Tories argue that the Neo-Victorian dream is a crude, disgusting mockery of Britain's former glory, and that Britain needs an orderly, traditional society where White, Christian civilizational values and Britain's heroes are held dear.

However, with Britain stripped bare, only boundless opportunities for growth remain in its recovery. Both the Neo-Victorians and the Tories have their visions of what should ultimately be done for Britain's economy, with Mogg's Tories urging for closer government cooperation with leading figures in business and enterprise, while the Neo-Victorians continue to insist that Britain's economy can only truly prosper when the state adopts a revitalized package of laissez-faire measures and further deregulates the markets, allowing for the "invisible hand" of the free market to naturally develop it."

Mogg took an impassioned approach, appealing to the romantic nationalism of British military tradition and urging for a "People's Army", capable of taking on its enemies through both expertise and size, emphasizing discipline along with the role of Britain's aristocracy and commoners alike. Mogg's sentimentality was ignored altogether in Patterson's proposal, instead voicing his confidence in creating a relatively smaller, but wholly professional force, armed with the cutting edge of experimental military technology and capable of using such an arsenal to devastating effect."

The election was held without incident, and as results came in, it was apparent that the factionalism within the party has finally come to an end, with its new leader having coasted from success within the House of Commons to a much firmer position of authority.\nAlthough everyone in Kent had their own sympathies, most people are relieved that the government is finally capable of running the nation it seeks to save."

After consulting with him personally on the matter, our diplomats have managed to convince him into parting ways with a rather large amount of uranium, for a reasonable price of course.
