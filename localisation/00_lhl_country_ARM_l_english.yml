 ARM_event.0.t:0 "Free elections in Armenia"
 ARM_event.0.d:0 "After so many years of servitude under foreign tyrants, the Armenian people are finally independent. But not only are they independent, they are also free. They are not under a dictatorship, but under a government that is actively preparing to hold elections - against their better judgement. \n\n Margarita Simonyan has for many years opposed the idea of elections in Armenia because she believes that if they were truly fair, then fascists would win and be swept into power. However, for whatever reason, she has decided that it would be preferable to go ahead with elections anyways, either due to optimism or lack of any other option. With the political arena set, three main groups prepare to fight each other with flowery words, promises, propaganda, and possibly a bit of fraud: Majsurians' sovietophilic communist party, west-leaning "atlanticist" movement of Jirair Sefilyan, Armenian Revolutionary Front, and the Republican Party of Armenia, which, despite its' simple name, proposes the most radical views of ancient customs revival, including paganism, to make Armenia great again. All that’s left now is for the Armenian people to head to the voting booths and decide Armenia’s first democratically elected leader."
 ARM_event.0.a:0 "Freedom, at last"
 
 ARM_event.2.t:0 "A House Divided"
 ARM_event.2.d:0 "In Armenia’s first open elections, the Republican Party of Armenia has managed to come out on top. The big-tent traditionalist party was able to play to the Armenian people’s conservative tendencies and overpower the atlanticists, moderates and communists, and now Andranik Margaryan prepares to be sworn in to carry out his Tsegakhronist platform. However, the RPA’s broad appeal has caused cracks to form. Without a common enemy, the many factions within the party have begun to turn on each other. The most relevant of these are Viktor Vaganyan and his Rebirth faction, who believe Armenians are the rightful rulers of the entire world, and Armen Avetisyan and his Armenian-Aryans, the most radical and racialist wing of the RPA. Although for now the disagreements are limited to the sphere of debates and arguments, it may soon devolve into violence. Margaryan has a short window to consolidate his rule and defang or even entirely remove the factions before the Armenian spill each other's blood."
