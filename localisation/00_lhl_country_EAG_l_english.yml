 EAG_event.1.t:0 "Stowmarket encouter"
 EAG_event.1.d:0 "Today is a good day! Our troops have easily seized the small town of Stowmarket from despicable crowds of thugs, with relatively small casualties. The town, while not particularly large in size or population, will nevertheless come under military occupation for a lasting duration until order is properly restored. Our Military police have reported widespread looting attempts have been prevented, with the mercenary force no doubt needing to be reigned in even further following this chaos. However, in order to appease them and keep their loyalty unwavering, some of our general staff have suggested letting the looting by the mercenaries run its course, despite the protests from the inhabitants of the town. Unfortunately as a side effect of this option, it may be harder to convince the locals of the legitimacy of our regime."

When our operation was officially halted, it only became worse.\nDespite our honest efforts to prevent mass requisitions of food and small arms from the civilians and local police force, with each day this task becomes even more Sisyphean.\nTo stop this, our collaboration government announced a tender for the local entrepreneurs to take of care about this colossus on the feet of clay.\nThe competition was won by two highly competitive gentleman, with two different unequal solutions.\nAlex Whitehouse, the major food producer in the pre-war Britain, would use his skills and past connections to ensure a constant flow of rations and consumer goods into our army, but he wouldn't be able to help us with the military-related goods.\nPhillip Yea, liquor magnate and a private equity investor, proposed to use his own connections to get a reverse effect, ensuring what our army get the best possible equipment by cutting our losses on food and continuing our civilian requisitions."

They plan to give the people of Anglia, and furthermore the rest of the island as many freedoms in a decentralized government based on Mercenary morals.\nThe National Anarchists on the other hand, under Southgate, mentioned the fact that without their militias the front would have collapsed from the enemy's counter attacks. They wish to implement their manifesto on the nation, and Klumb himself is somewhat sympathetic to their cause.\nLast but not least is Klumb himself, having used the might of German tanks previously provided to intervention forces in which helped minimize losses from the operation on London. He wishes to bring his views of his fatherland, a conservative federal republic.\nThe heads of the intervention forces, as well as the council itself, decide on the future now."

 EAG_EAST_CITY_HELP_PLEASE:0"§YREGION INFLUENCE MECHANIC:§!\n\nThis mechanic allows you to complete various beneficial projects. The currently accessible projects can be found under the §YAVAILABLE PROJECTS§! decision bar.\n\nStarting a project requires a certain budget. Region budget can be accumulated with §Opolitical power§! through the §YBUDGET DECISIONS§! options.\n\nOnce a project has been selected, a countdown will begin. At this point, you will be provided with new decision options under the §YCITY REQUESTS§! bar. You will be able to plead various regions of the country for their §GINFLUECNE§!. To successfully launch a project, you have to accumulate at least half the total amount of influence cities possess (the exact number will be displayed above the decision menu).\n\nWhile you can successfully lobby the desired project without convincing all six states, every state that doesn't vote in favour of the project will give you §R-2%§! stability, when the project is complete. \n\nYou can view the short description of the states, the amount of §GINFLUECNE§! they posses and what regions constitute the aformentioned region by pressing on the corresponding §YCOAT OF ARMS.§!\n\nThe §GINFLUECNE§! of a region can be increased by building §YINFRASTRUCTURE§!, §YCIVILIAN§! and §YMILITARY FACTORIES§! in the constituting states.\n\nOnce a month, one of the six states will ask you to lobby their own project. Their §GINFLUECNE§! will automatically be added to the total state §GINFLUECNE§! number. "
